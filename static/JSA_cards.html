	<p>I was asked by the Japanese Student Association JSA of UCSD to join their design competition for the next yearly membership card and shirt. These items are symbols of loyalty and pride to the club, and identify the members on outings. Both the winning card and shirt were ones which I designed.</p>


	<p>Each card was designed to reflect a different feeling. However, all cards use a traditional Japanese color palette and motif.</p>
